Initialization and Representation:

__init__(self, arr): Initializes an instance of the class, typically with an array arr.
__repr__(self): Defines the string representation of the object, used by repr().
Numeric Operations:

__add__(self, other): Handles addition (+) with other.
__sub__(self, other): Handles subtraction (-) with other.
__mul__(self, other): Handles multiplication (*) with other.
__truediv__(self, other): Handles true division (/) with other.
__floordiv__(self, other): Handles floor division (//) with other.
__mod__(self, other): Handles modulus (%) with other.
__pow__(self, other[, modulo]): Handles exponentiation (**) with other.
Comparison Operators:

__eq__(self, other): Defines equality (==) comparison with other.
__ne__(self, other): Defines non-equality (!=) comparison with other.
__lt__(self, other): Defines less-than (<) comparison with other.
__le__(self, other): Defines less-than or equal-to (<=) comparison with other.
__gt__(self, other): Defines greater-than (>) comparison with other.
__ge__(self, other): Defines greater-than or equal-to (>=) comparison with other.
Unary Operators:

__neg__(self): Defines negation (-self).
__pos__(self): Defines unary plus (+self).
__abs__(self): Defines absolute value (abs(self)).
Container Methods:

__len__(self): Defines the length of the object (len(self)).
__getitem__(self, key): Allows indexing (self[key]).
__setitem__(self, key, value): Allows assignment to indexed elements (self[key] = value).
__delitem__(self, key): Allows deletion of indexed elements (del self[key]).
Iteration and Context Managers:

__iter__(self): Returns an iterator object.
__next__(self): Defines behavior for iterating over instances (next() function).
Context Managers:

__enter__(self): Called when entering a context (used with with statement).
__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback): Called when exiting a context.
Type Conversion:

__int__(self): Converts the object to an integer (int(self)).
__float__(self): Converts the object to a float (float(self)).
__str__(self): Converts the object to a string (str(self)).
Miscellaneous:

__call__(self, *args, **kwargs): Allows the instance to be called as a function (instance()).
